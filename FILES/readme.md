Notes: The files in `OUTPUT` need to be put into a RAW hard disk image. I'm not exactly sure how to accomplish this yet as I'm not familiar with Fake86.

`FILESHERE` is where the Windows 95 B installation goes (everything in C:)

`OUTPUT` is where the files are outputted to.

`CDIMAGE` (needs reorganized) is supposed to be the CD root.
