This is a program from Microsoft designed to give you detailed information
on your particular computer system with the ability to browse through the
memory of your bios and ram.  You can get detailed information about the
location and size of TSR programs and all installed devices including
serial and parallel ports.  Designed to run before you call for technical
assistance from Microsoft, but very useful for snooping in your system
especially if you are having problems with interference between TSR's
or installed devices.  Educational even if you are not having system
problems.
